# Magic Cards


### Requirements
- Make sure all 4 suits of cards are rendered. There are 13 cards in each suit (♥,   ♣, ♦, ♠).
- Make sure the value for each card is visible on the initial render, basically move each card a bit so the card is readable.
- Add 3 buttons to the flow that will do 3 actions:
  - **Shuffle:** Randomly shuffles all cards.
  - **Show/Hide:** Hide all the cards by adding a class.
  - **Magic:** Order the cards again by suit.
- When performing the trick, use the existing cards rather then create new ones.
